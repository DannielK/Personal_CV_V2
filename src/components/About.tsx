        Hi! I am a recent Computer Engineering graduate from the University of
        California, Riverside, with a strong foundation in software engineering,
        web development, and embedded systems. My academic background,
        complemented by hands-on experience in full-stack development and
        technical support, has equipped me with a diverse skill set in
        programming, problem-solving, and system design.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        I have successfully contributed to several collaborative projects,
        including developing web applications with Next.js, TypeScript, and
        Firebase, as well as designing real-time embedded systems powered by
        C++, Python, and Arduino. I thrive in team-oriented environments,
        leveraging agile methodologies to deliver high-quality solutions that
        optimize performance and enhance user experiences.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Outside of tech, you’ll find me binge-watching TV shows, gaming,
        weightlifting, trying out new foods, hiking, or hanging out with friends
        and family. I’m excited to bring my skills, curiosity, and enthusiasm to
        a new grad software engineering role where I can contribute to
        meaningful projects and continue to grow.
